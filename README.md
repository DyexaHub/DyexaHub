Hello everyone

DyexaHub/DyexaHub on ✨ beginning ✨ repository because its `README.md` appears.

Linux and basic programming was caught my eyes
I would love to learn more about basic programming [ HTML, CSS, JS ] and intermediate Linux.
I’m currently learning Linux Debian at Vocational High School
Also interest on networking with Cisco and other tools.
I’m looking to collaborate on anything :)

I'd love to receive any help, advice, and suggestions cause I'm still learning with GitHub.

Thank you ☆
